We need a new workflow model to facilitate:

* branching workflows
* multiple inputs and outputs
* multiple input types and output types

There are a LOT of extra things we could do (e.g. conditional inputs, cyclic workflows, time-based execution), but we're gonna keep it simple for now.

* Proposed model: [[New Workflow Model - Specification]]
* Workflow validation: [[New Workflow Model - Validation]]
* WorkflowRun creation and execution: [[New Workflow Model - WorkflowRun Creation and Execution]]
