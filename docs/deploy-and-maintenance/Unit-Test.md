Test data is generated by `model_mommy`, instead of provided by Django fixtures. `model_mommy` automatically creates all required foreign key relationships and populates them with arbitrary data, and thus the test data can focus on the most important aspects of the model and is not subject to any changes in Rodan model.

A test case should inherit `RodanTestSetUpMixin` and `RodanTestTearDownMixin` together with REST Framework's `APITestCase`. `RodanTestSetUpMixin` provides several methods named `setUp_xxx()` to create objects using `model_mommy` and attach them to `self`. `RodanTestTearDownMixin` deletes the temporary folder used during test. It should be noted that the `Project` and `Resource` folders during test are not the same with production folder -- during the test the media folder is set to a temporary folder and `RodanTestTearDownMixin` cleans the temporary filesystem. Therefore, the sequence of the base classes is important: 

````python
class MyRodanTestCase(RodanTestTearDownMixin, APITestCase, RodanTestSetUpMixin)
````

`RodanTestTearDownMixin` must be put as the first of the list to mask the empty `tearDown` method of `APITestCase`.

The tests on views use superuser to perform to avoid being connected with permission system. The permission test is provided as separate test classes.
